Project completed on Codecademy: iterating over arrays to improve the quality of a paragraph and gather some information about that paragraph.

This is the same type of work that word processing software does. Linting is a process by which text is evaluated and improved by an application. In this project, we create a miniature version of a linter using array methods.
